Hina,<br>

I want to be the JAY in your life, who doesn't wear blue shirts and never maintains a To-Do list because he knows, a perfect relationship doesn't exist. <br>
I want to be the Dr. ARMAAN MALIK in your life, who is not a Doctor but an engineer, who can still increase your Breath by coming near.<br>
I want to be the MADDY in your life, who is RAJEEV (from America) and eats chicken but enjoys eating your leftover and helping in the kitchen. <br>
I want to be HARRY in your life, who will travel the world with you, in order to keep the SEJAL alive in you.<br>
I want to be the AMAN in your life, who is ready to wipe your tears, but never wants to show his fears.<br>
I want to be the RAHUL in your life, who believes love happens once in Life, you only marry once & can have only one wife.<br>
I want to be the BADRI in your life, who wants to impress you every day, But "will I ever speak correct English?", Can't Say.<br>

I LOVE YOU!<br>

Yours' <br>
